<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Fried rice is a traditional Chinese preparation of cooked rice, vegetables, protein, soy sauce, and aromatics. The ingredients are stir-fried in a large pan or wok for even flavor distribution. An ideal use for leftovers, fried rice is quick, customizable, and incredibly simple to put together with whatever is in your fridge.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li> ⅔ cup chopped baby carrots</li>
    <li> ½ cup frozen green peas</li>

    <li> 3 cups leftover cooked white rice</li>
    <li> 1 tablespoon soy sauce, or more to taste</li>

<h4>Cook's Notes:</h4>
<p>If you don't have any leftover cooked rice, here's how to make it: Combine 4 cups water and 2 cups white rice in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. For the best fried rice results, cover and refrigerate the rice, 8 hours to overnight, before using in this recipe.</p>
